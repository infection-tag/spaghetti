# The Spaghetti Project is now Archived

The Spaghetti Project is now archived. It never had much, but it worked. I suggest using a better alternative, [Jellyfin](https://jellyfin.org/).

Old README:

## Spaghetti

**Spaghetti** is a local, web-based video-management service. It is built to have the same look-and-feel as Netflix, but a lot simpler. Eventually, I want to include the option to upload your own movies, but that is coming later. For now, enjoy!
